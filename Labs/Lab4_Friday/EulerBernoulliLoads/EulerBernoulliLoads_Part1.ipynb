    "Let $u(x)$ denote the vertical deflection of the beam and let $m(x)$ denote the vertial force acting on the beam at point $x$ (positive for upwards, negative for downwards).  We assume that the displacement can be well approximated using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and thus satisfies the PDE\n",

    "- With the Gaussian process tools in MUQ, spatial locations are treated as columns of a matrix.  In 1D, this means that that the list of finite difference nodes will be a row vector.  This means that `x.shape` should return $(1,N)$, where $N$ is the number of points in the finite difference discretization.\n",
